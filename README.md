The data is used to show the characteristics of length and width of sepals and of the petals.

This dataset is highly regarded and is used to help users understand concepts in data exploration, machine learning, and data visualization. It also helps to demonstrate a lot of concepts in data science. The user can analyse different areas of the dataset, such as data distribution, correlations between the different features, and to show when there are outliers.
